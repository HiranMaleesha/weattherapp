Clean and user-friendly UI.
Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:

Flutter SDK
Android Studio or VS Code (for development)
A device or emulator to run the app (e.g., Android/iOS device or Android Emulator)
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Weather_mobile_app.git
cd Weather_mobile_app
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
flutter pub get
3. Configure an API Key
To fetch weather data, the app uses a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap). Follow these steps to configure the API key:

Register for an API key at OpenWeatherMap.

Add your API key to the app:

Open the lib/constants.dart file (or wherever your API key is configured).
Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:
dart
Copy code
const String apiKey = "4dbca896378d4704bfb155052240909";
4. Run the App
To run the app on an Android/iOS device or emulator, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flutter run
Make sure that a device or emulator is connected and running.

5. Build APK (Optional)
If you'd like to generate a release APK for Android, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
flutter build apk --release
The APK will be available in the build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/ directory.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, make sure that:

You have a stable internet connection (for fetching weather data).
Your Flutter SDK is up-to-date (flutter upgrade).
All dependencies are installed correctly (flutter pub get).
